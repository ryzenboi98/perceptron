# perceptron
This project represents a single-layer neural network with 3 inputs and 1 output.

## What is a Perceptron?
In a very simple way we can see a Perceptron as a neural network that has no hidden layers, it only has output and input layers.
It is used to represent the most basic case scenarios of neural networks.
